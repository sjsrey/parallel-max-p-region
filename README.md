# parallel-max-p-region
This is the parallel implementation of max-p region algorithm

In order to use this code, you will need pysal library. You can install pysal using the following command on windows command line.
pip install pysal

You can run this code using the following sample code max_p_region_run_example.py

Change lattice size as per your requirement w = pysal.lat2W(20,20)
Change threshold value as per your requirement floor = 100
